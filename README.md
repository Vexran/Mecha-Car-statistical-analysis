# Mecha-Car-statistical-analysis
## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
### Metrics
Collecting data for comparable models across all major manufacturers for the past 3 years for the following metrics:

Safety Feature Rating: Independent Variable
Current Price (Selling): Dependent Variable
Drive Package: Independent Variable
Engine (Electric, Hybrid, Gasoline / Conventional): Independent Variable
Resale Value: Independent Variable
Average Annual Cost of ownership (Maintenance): Independent Variable
MPG (Gasoline Efficiency): Independent Variable

### Hypothesis: Null and Alternative
After determining which factors are key for the MechaCar's genre:

Null Hypothesis (Ho): MechaCar is priced correctly based on its performance of critical factors for its genre.
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): MechaCar is NOT priced correctly based on the performance of critical factors for its genre.

### Tests
 A multiple linear regression would be used to determine the factors with the highest correlation/predictability 
 with the list selling price (dependent variable); which combination has the most significant impact on cost (it may be all of them!)
